                            Connect 4 or Four-in-a-Row has its roots in Tic-Tac-Toe, a simple three in a row pencil and paper game. The object of the game is to get four pieces in a row. Four-In-A-Row, 
                            also, adds the element of restricted placement by requiring the players to "drop" the pieces vertically down the board. In America, this game was popularized under the name Connect 
                            Four. The name “Connect Four” was first coined by Milton Bradley Company in 1974. The company was founded by Milton Bradley in Springfield, Massachusetts in 1860. The company is known for its contributions in the board game and video game industries.

                            switch at the right and left hand side of the board that is used to release the pieces from their slots thus resetting the board. The players take turns dropping pieces into the slots. These pieces fall to the bottom of the board and the 
                            game continues until one player has four in a row and wins or until the board fills up, which results in a tie.</div>

                            A key strategy to win is by making two simultaneous threats for the opponent. Usually this involves connecting three discs to prevent the opponent from having an advantage in that column. Also, remember that discs placed in the middle are more valuable 
                            then those place on the sides because players have more chances of creating four in a row with them.
